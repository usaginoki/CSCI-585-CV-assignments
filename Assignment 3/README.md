Report (basically) in assignment3.py file - its all comments (don't ask why)

Data must be structured as follows:
- Dataset
  - Training
    - male
      - img0.jpg
      - ...
    - female
      - imgo.jpg
      - ...
  - Testing
    - male
      - img0.jpg
      - ...
    - female
      - imgo.jpg
      - ...
